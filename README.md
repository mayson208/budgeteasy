BudgetEasy 💸

A modern envelope-based budgeting API built with Java & Spring Boot

BudgetEasy is a backend service that implements the classic envelope budgeting system: money is allocated into envelopes (categories), and transactions move money between them in a safe, rule-driven way.

This project is intentionally designed with clean architecture and domain-driven design (DDD) principles to showcase strong backend fundamentals.
